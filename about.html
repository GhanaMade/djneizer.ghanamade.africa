                                DJ Neizer was born on September 24, 1993, in Kumasi, Ashanti Region. However, his family originates from Elmina, Central Region in Ghana. DJ Neizer attributes much of his love for music by the support of his mother from a young age. He learned how to play the drums, the flute, and the keyboard and performed often at his church. At the age of 8, his interest in mixing as a disk jockey was piqued by observing his uncle, Frankie Taylor, who is a successful DJ and presenter at FOX FM in Kumasi. As he grew older, he went to his uncle’s studio often and by the age of 10 began performing at school functions.
